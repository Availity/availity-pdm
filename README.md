# availity-pdm

Availity’s Provider Data Management solution is built upon the premise that a practitioner or an authorized user within the provider office will update provider data as part of their regular workflows on the Availity Web Portal.  By combining provider data from a health plan, Availity’s data sensing technology, and our notifications utility, the information will be delivered to the right person at the
right time (in context) to insure that the data is verified and properly attested to.  



The [AvailityProvider.xsd](AvailityProvider1.3.1.xsd) schema represents an Availity provider (whether a practitioner or a group) in xml. Availity prefers that this is used as the 
standard format for data exchange, regardless of using real-time services via HTTP using SOAP or REST over XML or batch services 
(i.e. file-based with XML records).

Please refer to the PDM Implementation guide, Availity code sets and external provider dictionary artifacts for details.
